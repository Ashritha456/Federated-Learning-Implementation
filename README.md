# Federated-Learning-Implementation
# Big Data Privacy Using Federated Learning

This repository contains the implementation of a federated learning model with privacy-preserving techniques using differential privacy (DP). The goal is to train machine learning models in a federated environment where clients (e.g., hospitals, phones) train models locally, and only model updates are aggregated to a central server, preserving client privacy.

## Project Overview

The project demonstrates how to use federated learning with differential privacy to train a model securely across multiple clients. We utilize the following methods:
- **Federated Learning:** Distributes training across clients, ensuring data privacy.
- **Differential Privacy (DP):** Adds noise to model updates to protect individual privacy during training.
- **Secure Aggregation:** Aggregates model updates from clients securely to prevent data leakage.

## Key Components

1. **Federated Learning Framework:**
   - The model is trained using a federated learning setup, where multiple clients train local models, and only model updates are shared with a central server for aggregation.
   
2. **Differential Privacy (DP):**
   - Differential privacy is applied to the model updates to ensure that individual clients' data is protected. We use the [Opacus library](https://pytorch.org/opacus/) for adding DP noise to the gradients.

3. **Privacy Evaluation:**
   - We evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy and F1 score while ensuring privacy preservation with DP techniques.
   - Anomalous behavior detection to resist adversarial attacks.
